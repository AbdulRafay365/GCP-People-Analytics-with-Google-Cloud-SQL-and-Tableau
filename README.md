## About the Project

<div align="center">
  <img width="200" height="200" alt="project-logo" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfdfd4a4-ad09-4e63-b487-76f975ded2c4" />

In this project, I explored the domain of **People Analytics**, emphasizing its value in making data-driven decisions about a company’s most critical resource — its people. 

Through this journey, I:

- Learned the **fundamentals of People Analytics** and its real-world applications.
- **Generated realistic HR datasets** using Python.
- **Processed and stored** the data using Google Cloud SQL.
- **Performed ad-hoc reporting** and query-based exploration with SQL.
- Built an interactive **dashboard in Tableau** focused on **employee demographics** and **income trends**.

The end goal was to complete the full People Analytics cycle — from data wrangling to insight generation.

## What is People Analytics?

> *People analytics is the practice of collecting and analyzing workforce data to convert it into actionable insights that improve organizational outcomes.*  
> — [Visier](https://www.visier.com/people-analytics/#what-is-people-analytics)

Also known as **Workforce Analytics** or **HR Analytics**, People Analytics focuses on employee-centric data and helps HR professionals solve problems like:

- High turnover  
- Low engagement  
- Skill gaps  
- Diversity and inclusion metrics

> Note: While traditional **reporting** provides static summaries, **people analytics** uses advanced techniques to **uncover patterns**, **predict outcomes**, and **inform strategic decisions**.

## The Three Pillars of People Analytics  
_Source: [Visier](https://www.visier.com/people-analytics/#what-is-people-analytics)_

1. **Data**  
   Sourced from tools like HRIS, ATS, HCM, and payroll systems — the raw foundation of people analytics.

2. **Analytics**  
   The process of transforming raw data into insights using statistical models, SQL queries, and machine learning.

3. **Insights**  
   Delivered in the form of dashboards, charts, and reports that support decision-making at all organizational levels.

### Key Components:

#### 1. **Identify Core HR Problems**
Start with clearly defined objectives. Examples include:
- Reducing voluntary attrition
- Improving DEI metrics
- Enhancing new hire retention

Avoid trying to solve everything at once — prioritize based on business impact.

#### 2. **Audit Data Sources & Gaps**
Evaluate:
- Are your data sources comprehensive?
- Is the data recent, reliable, and clean?
- What additional data would help solve the problem?

#### 3. **Translate Insights into Actions**
People analytics isn't just an HR function. Involve:
- Line managers  
- Business leaders  
- Cross-functional teams  

Share insights organization-wide for better alignment and faster execution.

#### 4. **Monitor, Learn, and Evolve**
Like any agile process, a good strategy is **iterative**. Use:
- KPIs to track performance  
- Feedback loops to improve analysis  
- Regular updates to expand data coverage
